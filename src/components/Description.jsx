            <p>Porticode is a 24-hour event run by UCLU Technology Society, where you'll be given all the workshops, tools, mentors and snacks you'll need to create new and interesting ideas. These kind of events are also known as hackathons, but don't worry! This isn't about hacking into banks or shops, but rather about creating something you think is interesting, life changing, or just plain ridiculous.
              <br /><br />
              What can you make? As long as you can build it with the tech that we have available (as well as any you want to bring), and you can do it in one day, then it's fair game. Your project could be useful for the real world or it can have no use at all!
              <br /><br />
              Once the 24 hours are over, you'll be given the opportunity to show off what you've done in a 'science fair' style setting, and also the chance to demonstrate your creation in front of other attendees. Also, during the weekend, we'll be holding mini-events and games, to give you a break from your projects.
